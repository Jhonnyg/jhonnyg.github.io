            <p>
            Experienced developer with strong knowledge and interest in 3D programming and front-end development. Received my Master’s Degree in Computer Science in late 2011 and have been working with web-based real-time rendering since then. My primary role thus far has been to develop and maintain the codebase used for the render engine and backend tools. I have also gained experience with marketing, sales meetings as well as close customer relations. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy writing code and doing graphic design for various projects such as games, tools and visual experiments. I also try to attend hackathons whenever possible, and have won  several prizes. I also play several instruments and have recorded and produced a full-length album together with my band.

            Continued working on the render engine previously built at Meindbender, adding features and new core technology into the product. Work also included building a pre-process pipeline with direct integration into Autodesk Maya and 3D Studio Max with focus on artist usability. Some of the work I did include:

            <ul>
              <li type="circle">Image-based filtering of the real-time ray tracer for per-object roughness. Also built an in-engine material picker and editor for the various material properties.</li>
              <li type="circle">Network and backend code for a distributed texture baking solution across a compute cluster.</li>
              <li type="circle">Integrated Lua-based backend into Autodesk products for content publishing.</li>
              <li type="circle">Android and iOS port of WebGL Engine.</li>
